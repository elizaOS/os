# Shared elizaOS product layer.
#
# Per-target product makefiles (Cuttlefish, Pixel codenames) inherit from
# the matching device makefile first, then `inherit-product` this file.
# Anything that should hold for *every* elizaOS image lands here.
#
# Invariants:
#   1. The Eliza APK is installed as a privileged system app.
#   2. The privapp / default-permissions XMLs ship under /system/etc/.
#   3. Every stock app whose role we override is removed from
#      PRODUCT_PACKAGES so the resolver has a single answer for HOME,
#      DIALER, SMS, ASSISTANT, contacts, browser, calendar, camera,
#      gallery, music, deskclock, search.
#   4. First-boot setup wizard / provisioning is disabled — the device
#      must boot directly to Eliza, not to a Google "Welcome" flow.
#   5. Brand properties land on /product/ where the product layer owns
#      them, not on /system.
#   6. The assistant/full-control capability manifest is baked into
#      /product/etc/eliza/ for static image validation and field debug.

# KNOWN GAP: `-=` is not a make (or kati) operator — this block is currently
# a no-op that defines a stray variable, so none of these stock apps are
# actually removed from any image. Even a working subtraction here could not
# remove packages contributed by inherited makefiles (inherit-product
# aggregation is deferred past this file's evaluation). Role/HOME defaults in
# vendor/eliza/overlays keep Eliza in front regardless; the real de-bloat
# needs a supported mechanism and boot-level verification. Tracked as a
# follow-up; do not trust this list as a removal contract.
